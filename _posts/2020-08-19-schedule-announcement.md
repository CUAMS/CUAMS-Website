In continuing caution regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the committee has decided to carry out **all CUAMS activities online for the duration of the Michaelmas term**. This will happen primarily through the society [Discord]({{ site.discord_link }}). The Tuesday main meetings will happen at the usual time, and will involve discussing the specified episodes of the anime, which you are asked to watch beforehand. Instead of a typical sunday meeting there are plans to instead have a manga book club, with more details to come closer to term.

At the main meetings we will be discussing the following shows: **Given**, **Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!** (Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na!) and **Land of the Lustrous** (Houseki no Kuni). More details on the shows can be found on [the Meetings page.](/meetings) 

There are also plans to hold a **Virtual Fresher's Squash** on the **13th of October**, where we will watch **Wolf Children**. Dates and times will be available on [the Schedule page](/schedule), and again more information will arrive closer to term.

As of yet the plans for Lent and Easter are undecided, and will be dependant on the developing guidance from the government and the university in regards to gatherings and social distancing.

We hope you're as excited as we are to watch these shows and talk about them together! Please fell free to hop onto [our Discord]({{ site.discord_link }}) and take a look at the #schedule_discussion channel to discuss the planned shows. **Bonus:** The [the Committee page](/committee) page now has our discord usernames, why not stop by and say hi?
