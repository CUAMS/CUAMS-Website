A bonus meeting has been booked for the last Thursday of term, the **5th of March**. It is to be a joint meeting with the **Anglia Ruskin Anime Society**, and some time will be spent getting to know their members, and maybe playing some cards with them.

It will be held in the **Angevin Room** in Queen's, at **7:30pm**. We will be watching the 2015 film, **The Anthem of the Heart**.

We look forward to seeing you there!
