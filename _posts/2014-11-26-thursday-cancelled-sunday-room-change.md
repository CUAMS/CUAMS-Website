title: Thursday Cancelled, Sunday Room Change

Sadly, the meeting on **Thursday, 27 November** is **cancelled** due to a lack of room in which to hold the meeting. The next Thursday meeting will see the end of the current series, and there will be no bonus Thursday this term.
The meeting on **Sunday, 30 November** will still occur but in an unusual place: the **Music Practice Room,** Robinson College. As you enter the college, turn right and walk along the Long Court as you would to reach the Umney Lounge, but instead of entering through the doors next to the stairs at the end of the Long Court, go up the stairs. Go right across the High Court and through the doors at the very end.
