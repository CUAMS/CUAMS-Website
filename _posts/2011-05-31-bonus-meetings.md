From this Thursday onwards, main meetings and Sunday meetings are replaced by bonus meetings during the exam period. The schedule is Soredemo Machi Wa Mawatteiru, Kino's Travels and GA ~Geijutsuka Art Design Class~. Timings are as always, and the episodes in these series are fairly standalone so feel free to come to any meetings you can attend.
