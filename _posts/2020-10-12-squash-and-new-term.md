This is a reminder that our **(virtual) Freshers' Squash** is happening **tomorrow (Tuesday 13th October)** from **7pm on our [Discord server]({{ site.discord_link }})** where we will be watching **Wolf Children** by Mamoru Osoda. We will also be playing some games together  on the Discord beforehand from 5pm for people to meet and get to know each other. This may include Among Us, Scribbl.io, Jackbox Party, and other free games that members find online.

If you would prefer not to watch the film together on Discord but still want to be involved, you are encouraged to watch the film in your own time, and to keep an eye on the Discord so you can join us for games and the post film discussion.

We'd like to extend a warm welcome to all the freshers and new members who have joined us over these past few weeks. **If you haven't signed up for the mailing list,** please do using [**this form**](https://forms.gle/W68Fi4AvYfizRS5H9) so that you can be kept up to date with society news. Also know that in our Discord server you can assign yourself roles in the #roles channel, by reacting to the respective message. This will keep you updated when we hold relevant events.

Unlike previous years, **membership is free for this Michaelmas term** as we have no running costs with online meetings, as opposed to in person ones. Weekly online meetings will begin from next Tuesday the 20th, and details of the shows we will be watching can be found on the [Meetings page.](/meetings)
