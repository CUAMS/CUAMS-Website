Our AGM took place yesterday, but one could be forgiven for not noticing it: all committee positions other than President and Treasurer have been retained by their previous holders. Yes, you read that right: Xanth has finally succeeded in stepping down after eight years of benevolent reign. Our new Supreme Leader is former Treasurer Alex, while the Treasurer position is taken up by Eduard.
