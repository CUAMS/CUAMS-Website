Yet another year has passed, and yet another AGM has taken place. Another absent attempt to seize presidential power failed to be prevented, while each of the other committee positions as ever had exactly one candidate running for it. With the evil RON soundly defeated by the vote, the glorious new committee consists of Xanth the President, Florence the Secretary, Alex the Treasurer, Lech the Catering Officer and Oleg the Webmaster. Kai is staying as Internal Officer for the time being; however, he is graduating this year, so we will need someone, preferably a member of Kingâ€™s College, to replace him by Michaelmas.
While we were at it, we also approved some minor changes in the constitution of the society, mainly to bring theory up to date with practice.
