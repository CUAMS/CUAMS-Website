Once again, the meeting tomorrow, on **Tuesday, 10 March,** will be in the **Auditorium Lounge, Robinson** College. To get there, go through the [main entrance](http://map.cam.ac.uk/?inst=robin) and straight across the courtyard, enter the door in front of you and immediately turn left. On the [college plan](http://www.robinson.cam.ac.uk/about/college_plan.php) the Auditorium Lounge is marked 2, although the door is nearer to the digit 3.
