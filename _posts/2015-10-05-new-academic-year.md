A new academic year has started at Cambridge, and with it comes a new year of anime!

Freshers and old members alike, come see us at the **[Freshers’ Fair](http://www.cusu.co.uk/get-involved/freshers-15)** in the **marquee** on **Parker’s Piece (row 14, stall 4)** on **Tuesday and Wednesday!**

Our first meeting will be the traditional **Freshers’ Squash** on a not-so-traditional day, the **Monday** of **12 October**, in the **[Bateman Auditorium](http://www.chambermusicians.org.uk/Bateman%20Auditorium.htm)** in Gonville and **Caius** College.

Finally, we welcome our new Secretary, Vijay! Vijay is studying medicine, so he may be stuck with this job for a few years.
