CUAMS will be holding a virtual version of our annual garden party this year. In lieu of Jesus Green, we will be celebrating on our Discord voice channel! For those not yet in the CUAMS Discord, you can join with the official **CUAMS discord server** link [**here.**]({{ site.discord_link }})

This will be happening next **Saturday, the 4th of July** and is planned to last from **17:00 to 21:00**. Please join us for chatting, Jackbox games, an Anime Music Quiz, and more!

There may or may not also be an impromptu date-related celebration instigated by a certain CUAMS member from a faraway land.

We look forward to seeing you there!
