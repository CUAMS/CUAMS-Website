Hopefully everyone enjoyed our squash (and especially the amazing Summer Wars). Our main meetings are on Thursdays, with the first one at **7pm on
Thursday, 21st October**. Thursday meetings this term (and probably all through this year) will take place in the same place as the squash i.e.
**the Chetwynd Room, King's College**.
We're following three series through this term - Working!!, Trapeze and Cross Game, and usually watching two episodes of each
per week, with breaks for drink and snack consumption. Some details are currently up on the [
Main Meetings](/meetings/main) page, and synopses will be up there shortly (for now, you can follow the ANN links for brief synopses).
Members from last year, note that there is **no Sunday meeting this week**. Sunday meetings will start next week - full details will be in the e-mail
and on the next news post.
