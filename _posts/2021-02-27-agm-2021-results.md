As you will be aware, the Annual General Meeting for the society took place on Friday evening, where the new committee was elected. The AGM ran smoothly and concluded with no issues. Without further ado, the new [CUAMS Committee](/committee) Members for 2021/2022, are:

- President: Alexander Kent
- Secretary: Eesa Ali
- Treasurer: Ethan Zajdek
- Webmaster: Aidan Brocklebank
- Catering Officer (Food Lord): Peter Barnett

A special congratulations to Alexander who is the third President running to be promoted there from Secretary. In addition, Aidan and Peter have retained their roles as Webmaster and Catering Officer respectively. A warm welcome to the new members of the committee as well!

We would like to extend a huge thanks to the previous 2019-2020 CUAMS Committee. In particular the fantastic job they did seeing the society through a challenging year, and innovating the society's activities where necessary. The [Discord]({{ site.discord_link }}) server is more active than ever, with users old and new participating in games nights and discussions on all things anime and manga related. Come and say hi if you haven't already!

We look forward to seeing you all in society events over the coming year.
