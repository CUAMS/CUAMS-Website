Tomorrowâ€™s meeting will be in the **Auditorium Lounge, Robinson** College. To get there, go through the [main entrance](http://map.cam.ac.uk/?inst=robin) and straight across the courtyard, enter the door in front of you and immediately turn left. On the [college plan](http://www.robinson.cam.ac.uk/about/college_plan.php) the Auditorium Lounge is marked 2, although the door is nearer to the digit 3.

We will also move into the Auditorium Lounge for the Tuesday meeting one month from now, on Tuesday, 10 February. We will remind everyone closer to that date.
