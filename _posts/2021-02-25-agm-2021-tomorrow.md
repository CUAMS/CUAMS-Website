This is just a reminder that our **Annual General Meeting** will be held on the **26th of February at 7pm,** on our [Discord server]({{ site.discord_link }}). This is the meeting where we vote for the people who will staff the [CUAMS Committee](/committee) for the following year.

The **deadline** to express interest in running for a committee position is **noon of the day of the AGM** so please send your presentation/materials to the secretary (ak2147@cam.ac.uk) by then if you plan on running.

We hope to see you all there!

Note: In case anyone is unaware, for Lent term CUAMS is not running normal anime meetings but is instead meeting every **Friday at 7pm** for online games, and generally hanging out and chatting. This is of course happening on the [Discord ]({{ site.discord_link }}).
