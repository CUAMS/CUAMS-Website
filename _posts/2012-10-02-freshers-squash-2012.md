In the beginning of every academic year, CUAMS holds the Freshers’ Squash, where two movies are shown, membership fees are collected and anime discs are raffled off. This year is no exception, and the Freshers’ Squash will be held on Tuesday, 9 October, from 7 pm to 10 pm, when we will see Macross Frontier the Movie: The False Songstress and another movie.
For a lack of other options, the location is the Auditorium Lounge at Robinson College. Getting to the Auditorium Lounge from the main entrance is very simple: just keep walking forward in a straight line until you hit a glass door. When inside, you should hear and see us, but if not, you want the door on your far left. As ever, a [college plan](http://www.robinson.cam.ac.uk/about/college_plan.php) is available if you do not feel confident in these instructions.
