As you are probably aware, **we will be unable to meet for Easter term** as the university will remain closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, this means that we will not be able to finish the shows that were scheduled for the Easter term in official CUAMS meetings.

All of the currently scheduled shows, with the exception of Spice & Wolf, are available on Crunchyroll in the UK and we highly recommend watching them during the long period of social distancing/lockdown that lies ahead of us.

If you wish to discuss the shows or keep in touch with other members of the society in general during these times, feel free to join the **official CUAMS discord server** linked [here.]({{ site.discord_link }})

On behalf of the committee, we wish you all the best of health.
