The society thanks everyone who came to the Fresher's Squash - we hope you had a great time at our first showing of the year! And we are excited to announce the start of the regular meetings this term, starting today, **Tuesday the 19th**!

The meeting will be taking place from **7:00pm - 11:00pm** in **Keynes Hall, King's College**<!--more--> (see [**this map**](/assets/images/posts/KingsMap.png) for directions). The precautions will be broadly similar to the squash last week, though King's sadly doesn't allow food in the hall. Do feel free to grab something to eat before the meeting, or during a break, at King's bar.

We will be watching the first **3** episodes of *Baccano* followed by the first **3** episodes of *Yuri on Ice*. Unfortunately due to licensing issues, we **will not** be able to start showing *Kakushigoto* tomorrow. We do hope to start showing it next week, but keep an eye the [Discord]({{ site.discord_link }}) and society emails for details.  

Also for your information: **next week's meeting will be in Murray Edwards**. Details on the room will be specified closer to the date. Overall there will be 4 meetings at King's and 2 at Murray Edwards across this term.
