Another new year begins at Cambridge. Welcome and welcome back to students new and old. As always, there are still a few finishing touches to be put
to the schedule (current members can view it in its near-completed state on the wiki). We have, however, been allocated a stall at the Freshers' Fair.
The fair takes place at **Kelsey Kerridge on the 5th October between 11am and 6:30pm and on the 6th October between 10am and 3pm**. We'll be at
**stall D12** (a map of the stall locations can be found [here](http://www.cusu.cam.ac.uk/societies/fair/SocFair_2010_floorplan.pdf)) -
come along to ask any questions you might have, and to sign up to our mailing list.
