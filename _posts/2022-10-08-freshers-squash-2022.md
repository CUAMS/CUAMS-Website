Hello everyone! Freshers' Squash is a yearly event at CUAMS that exists for new joiners and existing members to meet and talk to fellow anime and manga fans and make friends in a relaxed atmosphere. Society members are free to join any of our other events regardless of whether they attend the Freshers' Squash. Fresher's Squash will be ran at **19:30** on **Sunday 9th October** in [**Keynes' Hall at King's College**](/assets/images/posts/keynes-hall.jpg), however entry will be possible from 18:00. A CUAMS committee member will be available at the King's College Porters' Lodge with a CUAMS sign to let you in. If you cannot find your way or arrive late, please ping @committee in the Discord server for assistance.

The schedule will consist of a screening of [5 centimeters per second](https://myanimelist.net/anime/1689/Byousoku_5_Centimeter) at 18:15, people may either choose to join the screening or remain in the outer room if they wish to chat. This will be followed by a short introduction to the general operation of the society and the current committee members at approximately 19:30. During the event, we will be hosting a team-based anime pub quiz and drawing games to help people to get to know each other.

For those willing to pay the optional CUAMS membership fee **(no payment is required to attend CUAMS meetings)**, there will also be a raffle for an opportunity to win a range of prizes, including anime Blu-rays and DVDs provided by distributors we are working with. Membership will be further explained within the introduction talk.
