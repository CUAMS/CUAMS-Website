Another year is behind us, marked by another AGM. Only *one person* stepped up to fill any of the open positions. Really? If you can do catering or master the Web, contact anyone who seems involved in the organisation of meetings!
On a brighter note, we thank Oli for his great job as Secretary for the last half year and welcome on board his successor: Max!
