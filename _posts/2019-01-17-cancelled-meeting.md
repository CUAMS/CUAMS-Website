It is with great regret that we have to cancel our regular meetings this Sunday
20th and Tuesday 22nd due to unexpected licensing complications.

This is definitely not a desirable position to be in and we are as
disappointed as many of you must be. We hope that we will be able to resolve
these issues but it is possible that they could lead to the cancellation of
future meetings as well. We will keep you informed of any further developments
as they happen and will hope to schedule some extra social events in missing
meeting spots and otherwise in the meantime.
