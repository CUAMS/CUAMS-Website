The **Annual General Meeting (AGM)** of the **Cambridge University Anime and Manga Society** is approaching fast. The event will take place on the **20th of February** at **7pm** at **Keynes Hall, King's College**.

Members interested in joining the society's committee will have the opportunity to present small, light-hearted presentations about themselves and the society or anime in general.

If you are interested in running for a role, please talk to one of the current committee members either in person or through Discord so that we can keep track of who is running for what place in advance. The responsibilities of each role are all viewable on the CUAMS wiki page.

We look forward to seeing you all there!
