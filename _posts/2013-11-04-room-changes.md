The nearest **two Tuesday** meetings will take place in unusual rooms due to booking conflicts.
**5 November** is in the **Erasmus Room, Queens’** College. To get there, go through the porters’ lodge, turn right, cross the river and then follow the directions you see on signs. The room is on the first floor. On the [college plan](http://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/mi-client/media/maps/sitemap-april13.jpg) it is marked 18.
**12 November** is in the **Auditorium Lounge, Robinson** College. Go through the [main entrance](http://map.cam.ac.uk/?inst=robin) and straight across the courtyard, enter the door in front of you and immediately turn left. On the [college plan](http://www.robinson.cam.ac.uk/about/college_plan.php) the Auditorium Lounge is marked 2, although the door is nearer to digit 3.
Sunday meetings, as well as further Tuesday meetings, will happen as usual.
