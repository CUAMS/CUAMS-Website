Hopefully everyone is enjoying the series that CUAMS has been showing, some of which will continue into next term. As we
near the end of the first term, there are a couple of changes to the norm worth noting. Firstly, this week's main meeting is on
**Friday, 26th November** rather than the usual Thursday. Secondly, this week's Sunday meeting is **starting at 3pm** rather than
the usual 4pm. We've also got some end-of-term bonus meetings coming up - more info on those nearer the time.
(As I imagine everyone noticed, the previous meeting was also on Friday, so this information should really have been up much sooner - sorry for
forgetting to update.)
