Because of the Promare film at the Vue Cambridge ([tickets](https://www.myvue.com/book-tickets/summary/10016/279326/213661)) overlapping with our meeting, we are rescheduling next week's Main Meeting from **Tuesday 26th November** to **Tuesday 3rd December** at the **JCR TV Room, Selwyn College**. We'll still be showing the last 2 episodes of **Hinamatsuri**, **SSSS.Gridman** and **ACCA-13**.  We'll keep you posted if details change.

Note that the room booking is not yet confirmed, so if you think you could get us a better room in your college, feel free to contact the committee through any of the standard channels.

Please see the mailing list or [Discord]({{site.discord_link}}) for more details.
