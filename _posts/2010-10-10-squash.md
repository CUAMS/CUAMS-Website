Thanks to everyone who visited our stall and signed up for the mailing list at the Freshers' Fair. We can now confirm that our Squash will be held in **the Chetwynd Room, King's College, from 7pm to 10pm on Thusday, 14th October**. The Chetwynd Room is where all our main meetings will be this term, and **directions can be found at the top of our
[Main Meetings page](/meetings/main)**.

At the squash, we will be showing two (excellent) standalone films. For everyone who joins CUAMS on the evening, we will also be holding a raffle with a
spectacular array of prizes courtesy of our friends at Beez. Membership is &pound;4 for a term and &pound;10 for the year, which pays for the food and drink we have at meetings. With the number
of anime DVDs and box sets we have to give away this year, there's a good chance of making your money back straight away, so it's well worth signing up.

Finally, note that the schedule is now up on the [schedule page](/schedule) in near-complete form. It's still
subject to minor change, but gives a pretty good picture of how we'll be spending the year.
