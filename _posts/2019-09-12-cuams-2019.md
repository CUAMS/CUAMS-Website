A new Cambridge academic year is fast approaching, and with it, a glorious new year of CUAMS. This post outlines our plans for the start of the year -- and a warm welcome (back) to everyone coming in October!

As usual, we’ll be at our stall at the [CUSU Freshers' Fair](https://www.cusu.co.uk/freshersfair/) on Tuesday 8th and Wednesday 9th October.

Our first society event of the year, the annual Freshers’ Squash, will be held in the Bowett Room, Queens’ College, at 7-10pm on Saturday 19th October. We’re delighted to announce we will be screening _Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms_ (2018, Mari Okada, P.A.Works). Many thanks to [AllTheAnime](https://www.alltheanime.com/) for allowing us to show this wonderful film. The programme will also include a mix of standalone shorts, and a raffle open to all members signing up on the day. Thank you to [AllTheAnime](https://www.alltheanime.com/), [MangaUK](https://www.mangauk.com/) and [MVM Entertainment](https://www.mvm-films.com/) for sponsoring our raffle prizes.

Regular meetings will begin shortly after, with Main and Sunday meetings scheduled to begin on Tuesday 22nd October and Sunday 27th October respectively. The 2019/20 meetings schedule is under development, and will appear on our [Meetings](/meetings) and [Schedule](/schedule) pages once finalised.

If you’ve not already, please join [our society Discord](https://discord.gg/aA3Cpqw) for the most up-to-date announcements, event information, and high-quality banter.

Get Hyped for a great year,  
CUAMS Committee
