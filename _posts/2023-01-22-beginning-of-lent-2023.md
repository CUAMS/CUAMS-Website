Welcome back, CUAMS members! We hope you had a wonderful break and are ready to dive into another term with us at the Cambridge University Anime & Manga Society.

As we begin the Lent 2023 term, we have many exciting activities planned for you. From anime screenings to karaoke, there is something for everyone. We encourage you to check the [term card](/assets/images/posts/lent-2023-term-card.png) for accurate information on dates and times, as well as any updates or changes that may occur. As always, joining the [mailing list](https://lists.srcf.net/mailman/listinfo/cuams-list) and the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/YehRnVkHxC) is the best way of getting information on events when they are scheduled.

We are looking forward to a fantastic term filled with anime and fun. Let's make the most of our time together!

Best, The CUAMS Committee
