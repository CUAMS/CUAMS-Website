Thanks to everyone who came to see us at the Freshers' Fair this year! Our **Freshers' Squash** is coming up very soon: it will be held on **14th October, 7-10pm, in the Bowett Room, Queens' College**! If you're unsure where to find us, we have a [map](/assets/images/posts/bowett-room.jpg) to help you out!

We will be showing ***Death Billiards*** and the movie ***Kimi no Na wa (Your Name)***, so you can get a feel for what CUAMS meetings are like.

Attendance is free and open to all, and plenty of snacks will be provided! You can also buy CUAMS membership at the squash (**£4/term, £10/year**), which also enters you into our annual raffle with a chance to win all sorts of anime-themed prizes - don't miss it!

We hope to see you there!
