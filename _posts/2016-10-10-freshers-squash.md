This year we shall be showing Kizuna Ichigeki and the Cowboy Bebop movie.

Attendance at the squash is free, with bountiful snacks provided. You will also have the opportunity to join CUAMS during the squash. It costs **£4** per term, or **£10** for the whole year.

Joining CUAMS at the squash also enters you in our raffle, with chances of winning a variety of anime/manga related goodies!
