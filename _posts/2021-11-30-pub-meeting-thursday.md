The society is pleased to announce that we will be doing another social event, following the successful meet two weeks ago. This will be a pub meet at **The Blue Moon** at **7:00pm** on **Thursday, the 2nd of December**, following a bowling outing at **Tenpin Bowling Alley** at **3:00pm**.<!--more--> The bowling is pre-booked but you can pay separately if you want to come and haven't signed up. And feel free to turn up to the pub, even if you didn't sign up - just bear in mind that we could run out of seats if many more people arrive than signed up, so get there on time to secure a seat.

The pub is at **2 Norfolk Street**, near the Grafton centre, and for those who have booked remember that Bowling is at the Leisure Park by Cambridge train station - and that you need to **bring Student ID**. 

We also hope to see you at the final anime meeting of the term on Tuesday, happening again in Keynes Hall, King's College, where we will be finishing _Baccano_, _Yuri!! on Ice_, and _Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun_.
