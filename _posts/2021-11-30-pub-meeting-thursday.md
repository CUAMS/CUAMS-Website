The society is pleased to announce that we will be doing another social event, following the successful meet two weeks ago. This will be a pub meet at **The Blue Moon** at **7:00pm** on **Thursday, the 2nd of December**<!--more-->, following a bowling outing at **Tenpin Bowling Alley** (which sadly is fully pre-booked). But if you want to come to the pub then feel free, even if you didn't sign up - just bear in mind that we could run out of seats if many more people arrive than signed up, so get there on time to secure a seat.

The pub is at **2 Norfolk Street**, near the Grafton centre, and for those who have already booked remember that Bowling is at **3:00pm** in the Leisure Park by Cambridge train station.

We also hope to see you at the final anime meeting of the term on Tuesday, happening again in Keynes Hall, King's College, where we will be finishing _Baccano_, _Yuri!! on Ice_, and _Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-Kun_.
