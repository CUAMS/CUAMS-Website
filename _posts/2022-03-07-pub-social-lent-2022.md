We are glad to announce that the society has organised a pub social that will run this week. It will be held at **The Maypole** (full address below) at **7pm** on **Tuesday, 8th of March**. This will be a great chance to meet and chat with fellow anime and manga fans, and it is **not** necessary to have attended the weekly meetings this term to be able to come.

Everyone is welcome to attend, however those who did not sign up using the form posted previously will not have a guaranteed seat due to limited space. 

In other news, the society is also planning to do a movie outing towards the end of term to watch the Jujutsu Kaisen 0: Movie together at **8pm** on **Sunday, 20th of March** at **Vue**. Feel free to book a seat if you wish to attend.

Lastly, please be aware that the main meeting next week at **Keynes Hall, Kingâ€™s College** on **Tuesday, 15th of March** will start at **7:30pm**.

Pub Address:
