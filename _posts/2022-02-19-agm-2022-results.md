Thank you to everyone who joined us on Friday for the 2022 CUAMS Annual General Meeting. The event ended with no complications and we elected the new committee to serve the society for the coming year, however above all we would like to thank our retiring and returning committee members for making it possible for the society to run fluidly throughout the last year despite the obstacles faced in these tough times. 

The new members of the 2021/2022 [CUAMS Committee](/committee) are as follows:

- President: Ethan Zajdek
- Secretary: Marcus September
- Treasurer: Ayshini Senadeera
- Webmaster: Bernard Dec
- Catering Officer (Food Lord): Piers Bowater
- External Officer: Elliot Leupolz
- Social Secretary: Haoran Cao

We would also especially like to thank our former president Alexander for seeing the society through despite already having graduated.

Once again, thank you to all those who attended and we look forward to seeing everyone at society events in the coming year.
