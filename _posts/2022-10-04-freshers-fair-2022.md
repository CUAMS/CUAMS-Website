CUAMS will be appearing this year at the Freshers' Fair both days (Parker's Piece on Tuesday 4th October and Wednesday 5th October) at stall Green-B06. Please feel free to come and ask our committee members any questions or just come by for a general chat should you wish. We will also be providing printed copies of our [Michaelmas term card](/assets/images/posts/2022-term-card.png) there.

If you are unable to come either day, do not fret. Any questions outside of the Freshers' Fair can be asked on the [CUAMS Discord](https://discord.com/invite/qCRwMsu8) where all of our CUAMS committee are available.
