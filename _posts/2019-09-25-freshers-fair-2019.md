The CUSU Freshers' Fair stall allocations are now up! We'll be there on both days (Tuesday 8th and Wednesday 9th October) at MH6; row H, table 6 in the Marquee on Parker's Piece. You'll be able to see a couple of the finest committee members we have to hand, have a chat, join our mailing list and maybe even pick up a flyer. We hope to see you there!

The schedule will be announced ahead of this date; we're currently waiting on licensing for a couple of shows in Lent, but we should be able to announce at least Michaelmas term by the end of the week!

If you want to get a feel for our activities before you arrive, feel free to check out rest of the website, and join our Discord server at https://discord.gg/aA3Cpqw to chat with existing members and others.
