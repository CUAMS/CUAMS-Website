Thanks to everyone who visited us at the Societies’ Fair, and welcome to the new academic year!

Our first meeting is the freshers’ squash on **Thursday, 16 October,** from **7 pm to 10 pm,** in the **Bowett Room, Queens’ College.** Come along (even if you weren’t at the fair or aren’t a student) to see some anime, get some snacks and drinks, sign up for membership and maybe even win a prize!

To get to the Bowett Room, follow the directions on [this map](/assets/images/posts/bowett-room.jpg). When you are inside the building circled on the map, go up the stairs on your right.

Most of our Thursday meetings this term will be in the same place. On Sundays, we will meet in Teaching Room 7 of Robinson College; see the [Sunday meeting page](/meetings/sunday) for directions.

Old members, be careful! This year our main day of week is **Thursday.**
