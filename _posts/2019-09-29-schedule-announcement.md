As mentioned in our [Freshers' Fair post]({% post_url 2019-09-25-freshers-fair-2019 %}), we're proud to announce our schedule for 2019/20! On Tuesdays in Michaelmas, we will be watching Hinamatsuri, SSSS.Gridman, and ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept (ACCA-13). On Sundays in Michaelmas, we will be watching Girls und Panzer, Seishun Buta Yarou (Bunny Girl Senpai), and School-Live! (Gakkou Gurashi). Meeting-by-meeting schedule details are on [our Schedule page](/schedule). Below we have outlined our plans for Lent and Easter.

In Lent, on Tuesdays we'll be showing Humanity has Declined! (Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita), followed by Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, and finishing meetings with Spice and Wolf. On Sundays, we'll be showing Blood Blockade Battlefront (Kekkai Sensen), followed by Plastic Memories. We're currently in the process of licensing the final show on Sundays -- we hope you're curious to find out what it is!

In Easter, many of the shows will continue -- Humanity has Declined! will make way for Angel Beats! for the first slot of Tuesday meetings, and Plastic Memories will make way for Granbelm in the second slot on Sundays. All other shows will move into their second season or second cour as appropriate.

We hope you're as excited as we are to watch these shows together! Feel free to hop onto [our Discord]({{ site.discord_link }})'s #schedule_discussion channel to discuss the contents of the announcement, and check out [the Meetings page](/meetings) to see the shows in more detail.
