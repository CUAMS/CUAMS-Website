Welcome back everyone, we hope everyone had a good Easter break. 
We are unfortunately unable to screen the second cour of Golden Time this term due to licensing reasons, so the committee has decided to host three other events instead:

- Anime-themed pub quiz
- Karaoke
- Anime movie screening of Night is Young, Walk on Girl

The details for these events can be found either on the [schedule](/schedule) or on the [Easter term card](/assets/images/posts/eastertermcard-2022.png).

Please note that the first event happens **this Sunday** at 7pm at King's College.
