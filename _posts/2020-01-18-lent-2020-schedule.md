It's a new term, which means new shows. On Tuesdays, we will be showing **Humanity has Declined!**, **Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu**, and **Spice and Wolf**; on Sundays, we will be showing **Kekkai Sensen**, **Plastic Memories**, and (newly-announced) **Hibike! Euphonium**. We wanted to make sure a KyoAni show made it onto the schedule after last year's events; apologies for the delays in licensing. As always, head to the [Meetings page](/meetings) for more details.
