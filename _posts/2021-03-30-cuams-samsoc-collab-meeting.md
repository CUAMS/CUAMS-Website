We are excited to announce a **collaboration between CUAMS and SAMSOC** (Surrey Anime and Manga Society) this coming **Friday**, that is the **2nd of April 2021** at **7pm BST**. Although the event cannot occur in person, through the magic of Discord, we are now unconstrained by geography!

The focus of the evening will be an **anime quiz** which will test all manner of anime trivia. It has been designed so that there is a mix of easier and more challenging questions so everyone will be able to have fun. As well as socialising, after the quiz we will likely continue with games both familiar and new.

On **Thursday** evening, the **link to the SAMSOC Discord server** will be posted on the [CUAMS Discord server]({{ site.discord_link }}), so we can get familiar before the event.

We hope to see you all Friday!
