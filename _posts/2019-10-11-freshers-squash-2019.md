Our first official meeting of the year, the Freshers' Squash, will be held on __Saturday 19th October__, 7-10pm, Bowett Room, Queens' College (directions [here](/assets/images/posts/bowett-room.jpg)).

The line-up will include four short OVAs: the _Daicon III and IV_ opening animations, produced by staff who would later form Gainax; _Dareka no Manazashi_; a short film by Makoto Shinkai; and _Shelter_, a Porter Robinson music video animated by A-1 Pictures). This will be followed by our main feature for the night, _Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms_, the directorial debut of Mari Okada (previously known for shows such as Anohana and Nagi no Asakura), animated by P.A. Works. Thank you to [AllTheAnime](https://www.alltheanime.com/) for allowing us to screen this visually-stunning and emotionally-poignant film.

The Freshers' Squash, like all of our regular meetings, is absolutely _free_ (and there will be snacks)! However, society membership will be up for purchase at the low, low price of £10 for the year (or £4 per term). We don't operate for profit, so all membership fees go straight back into the society i.e. towards purchasing the variety of supermarket-quality snacks we make available to members at each meeting. Members will also be entered into our annual _Fresher's Squash raffle_, drawn at the end of the night. Prizes include Blu-Rays and other goodies provided to us by our generous industry sponsors.

We hope to see you on the 19th!
