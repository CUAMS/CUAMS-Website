The Cambridge University Anglo-Japanese and Anime & Manga Societies are proud to present Masa-kun!
Masa-kun comes from London to give his debut performance in Cambridge. In demand by Japanese organisations and anime conventions alike, he'll entertain with a variety of Japanese songs, ranging from Hikaru Utada to Final Fantasy tunes. His philosophy is to entertain with his music, breaking away from the notion of the violin as a "classical" instrument. Masa-kun's performances can be seen on his [YouTube channel](http://www.youtube.com/masamusic123). He will be accompanied by [Hibiki Ichikawa](http://www.hibikishamisen.com/Home.html), a professional shamisen player, who is also currently touring the UK.
AJS will be running a raffle during the intermission, with several bottles of umeshu up for grabs!
