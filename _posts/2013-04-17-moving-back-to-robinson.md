After moving main meetings from Robinson to the more central Queens’ for Lent, we are now forced to move them back for Easter as Queens’ has quiet periods covering almost the entire term. While farther from the town centre, Robinson has always been very kind to us, and once again it welcomes us in the Auditorium Lounge every Tuesday.
Please note also that the **first Sunday meeting** of Easter will take place not in the Umney Lounge as usual but rather in **Teaching Room 7**. To get there, enter the door just opposite the porters’ lodge and go all the way up the stairs.
