We are excited to announce that the society has secured a booking at **The Castle Inn**, scheduled for later **today (18th November)** at **7:00pm!** We'll be in the upstairs area which has plenty of room, so feel free to come even if you didn't the form.<!--more--> Bear in mind there is still a possibility that we could run out of seating space, so arrive on time if you want to have dinner. The pub is located at **38 Castle Street** which is fairly close to the center of town, and less than a 15 minute walk from our usual meeting location at King's College.

We hope people enjoy doing something slightly different with the society, and if it isn't your thing then don't worry - for the last two weeks of term we will be having normal anime meetings, which will be back in King's.
