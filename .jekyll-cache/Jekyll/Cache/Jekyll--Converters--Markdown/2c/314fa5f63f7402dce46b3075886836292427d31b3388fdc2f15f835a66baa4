<p>We have been contacted by the University Library about a Manga Workshop they want to run:â€‹

<!--more--></p>

<p>To mark the 2020 Olympics in Japan, the UL will run an exhibition on the â€œCulture and Art of the Samuraiâ€ as part of their â€œSummer at the Museumsâ€ events. Among other things related to Japan, they also want to run a Manga Drawing Workshop for families, and they have appealed to us for potential volunteers.â€‹
â€‹</p>

<p>They have held similar events for cover/book illustration and cartonera but would appreciate the assistance of those more familiar with manga for this workshop.â€‹ The event will take place over the Summer Vacation with the workshops most likely in August.â€‹
â€‹</p>

<p>If this sounds interesting to you, and you would be willing to help the UL with running this workshop over the holidays, please email the Secretary <strong>(ak2147@cam.ac.uk)</strong> by the end of February, and he will discuss further with the UL if thereâ€™s interest.â€‹</p>
