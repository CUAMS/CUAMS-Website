I"³<p>Welcome back to Cambridge; hopefully everyoneâ€™s well rested from the Christmas break. The first main change to CUAMS
this term is that <strong>main meetings are now on Fridays, not Thursdays</strong>. Unfortunately this is due to room-booking circumstances outside
of our control, and we apologise if it clashes with any other Friday commitments people might have. The first main meeting of term is on
<strong>Friday, 28th January</strong>, and remains in the Chetwynd Room. Sunday meetings start on <strong>Sunday, 23rd January</strong>, and are in every respect
the same as they were last term. More complete information can be found on <a href="/schedule">the schedule page</a>.</p>
