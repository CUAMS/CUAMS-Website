I"m<p>Hopefully everyone enjoyed our squash (and especially the amazing Summer Wars). Our main meetings are on Thursdays, with the first one at <strong>7pm on
Thursday, 21st October</strong>. Thursday meetings this term (and probably all through this year) will take place in the same place as the squash i.e.
<strong>the Chetwynd Room, Kingâ€™s College</strong>.</p>
