I"Ì<p>Once again in true CUAMS style, this yearâ€™s elections were a shining example of democracy. The ever-present threat of RON fazed none of the contenders, with Xanth continuing his presidency for his seventh year (prophecies foretell an eight year of his benevolent endless reign). Katherine, Tom and Lech have also retained their positions as, respectively, secretary, internal officer and catering officer. Alex was elected as the new treasurer, with Kai assuming the position of webmaster, and Tom (a different one) practically bullied into becoming an eventual catering officer for a short period of time. Thanks to the outgoing treasurer Yingke and webmaster James for their hard work over the last year!</p>
