I"E<p>We were unable to book Queens’ this term. Nobody else stepped up to book a room in their college, and Robinson’s Auditorium Lounge has other events scheduled on some days, so we will be meeting in the <strong>Umney Lounge, Robinson College</strong> for all meetings, on <strong>both Tuesdays and Sundays</strong>.</p>
