I"k<p>Thanks to everyone who came to see us at the Freshers’ Fair this year! Our <strong>Freshers’ Squash</strong> is coming up very soon: it will be held on <strong>14th October, 7-10pm, in the Bowett Room, Queens’ College</strong>! If you’re unsure where to find us, we have a <a href="/assets/images/posts/bowett-room.jpg">map</a> to help you out!</p>

<p>We will be showing <strong><em>Death Billiards</em></strong> and the movie <strong><em>Kimi no Na wa (Your Name)</em></strong>, so you can get a feel for what CUAMS meetings are like.</p>

<p>Attendance is free and open to all, and plenty of snacks will be provided! You can also buy CUAMS membership at the squash (<strong>£4/term, £10/year</strong>), which also enters you into our annual raffle with a chance to win all sorts of anime-themed prizes - don’t miss it!</p>

<p>We hope to see you there!</p>
