I"2<p>Our first official meeting of the year, the Freshers’ Squash, will be held on <strong>Saturday 19th October</strong>, 7-10pm, Bowett Room, Queens’ College (directions <a href="/assets/images/posts/bowett-room.jpg">here</a>).</p>

<p>The line-up will include four short OVAs: the <em>Daicon III and IV</em> opening animations, produced by staff who would later form Gainax; <em>Dareka no Manazashi</em>; a short film by Makoto Shinkai; and <em>Shelter</em>, a Porter Robinson music video animated by A-1 Pictures). This will be followed by our main feature for the night, <em>Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms</em>, the directorial debut of Mari Okada (previously known for shows such as Anohana and Nagi no Asakura), animated by P.A. Works. Thank you to <a href="https://www.alltheanime.com/">AllTheAnime</a> for allowing us to screen this visually-stunning and emotionally-poignant film.</p>

<p>The Freshers’ Squash, like all of our regular meetings, is absolutely <em>free</em> (and there will be snacks)! However, society membership will be up for purchase at the low, low price of £10 for the year (or £4 per term). We don’t operate for profit, so all membership fees go straight back into the society i.e. towards purchasing the variety of supermarket-quality snacks we make available to members at each meeting. Members will also be entered into our annual <em>Fresher’s Squash raffle</em>, drawn at the end of the night. Prizes include Blu-Rays and other goodies provided to us by our generous industry sponsors.</p>

<p>We hope to see you on the 19th!</p>
