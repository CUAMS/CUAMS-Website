I"Œ<p>Due to :reasons:, all four of the remaining meetings are moved to the Umney Lounge at Robinson College. To get to the Umney Lounge, go through the main entrance to Robinson (on the corner of Grange Road and Herschel Road), immediately turn right and walk down the passage all the way down through two sets of glass doors. At this point you will see a sign saying Umney Theatre diagonally forward and left; the door next to the sign is the entrance to the Umney Lounge. There is also a <a href="http://www.robinson.cam.ac.uk/about/college_plan.php">college plan</a> available if you prefer graphics to words.</p>

<p>Meeting times are unchanged.</p>
