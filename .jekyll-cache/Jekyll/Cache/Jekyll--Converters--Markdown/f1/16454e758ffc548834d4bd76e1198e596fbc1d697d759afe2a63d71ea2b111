I"@<p>With the new year rapidly approaching we have many new things to announce! We
have both a fancy new website and a new schedule to let you know about.</p>

<p>As you can probably tell if you visited the website before, we’ve had a bit of
a clean up to help make the site look a bit prettier and modern: we hope you
like it!</p>

<p>We are also pleased to announce our new schedule that can be found on the
<a href="/meetings">meetings</a> page. We’re still finalising the details on the exact
dates / locations of some of the meetings so check back soon for more
information closer to the start of term.</p>

<p>Finally, to any potential new members (or existing members who just want to
say hello), we’ll be at the CUSU Freshers’ Fair on Tuesday 2nd October and
Wednesday 3rd October so we hope to see you all there!</p>
