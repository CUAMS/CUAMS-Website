I"@<p>In continuing caution regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the committee has decided to carry out <strong>all CUAMS activities online for the duration of the Michaelmas term</strong>. This will happen primarily through the society <a href="https://discord.gg/aA3Cpqw">Discord</a>. The Tuesday main meetings will happen at the usual time, and will involve discussing the specified episodes of the anime, which you are asked to watch beforehand. Instead of a typical sunday meeting there are plans to instead have a manga book club, with more details to come closer to term.</p>
