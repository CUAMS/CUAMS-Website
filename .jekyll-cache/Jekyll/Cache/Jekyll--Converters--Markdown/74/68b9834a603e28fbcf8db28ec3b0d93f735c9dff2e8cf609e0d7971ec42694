I" <p>A new Cambridge academic year is fast approaching, and with it, a glorious new year of CUAMS. This post outlines our plans for the start of the year â€“ and a warm welcome (back) to everyone coming in October!</p>

<p>As usual, weâ€™ll be at our stall at the <a href="https://www.cusu.co.uk/freshersfair/">CUSU Freshersâ€™ Fair</a> on Tuesday 8th and Wednesday 9th October.</p>

<p>Our first society event of the year, the annual Freshersâ€™ Squash, will be held in the Bowett Room, Queensâ€™ College, at 7-10pm on Saturday 19th October. Weâ€™re delighted to announce we will be screening <em>Maquia: When the Promised Flower Blooms</em> (2018, Mari Okada, P.A.Works). Many thanks to <a href="https://www.alltheanime.com/">AllTheAnime</a> for allowing us to show this wonderful film. The programme will also include a mix of standalone shorts, and a raffle open to all members signing up on the day. Thank you to <a href="https://www.alltheanime.com/">AllTheAnime</a>, <a href="https://www.mangauk.com/">MangaUK</a> and <a href="https://www.mvm-films.com/">MVM Entertainment</a> for sponsoring our raffle prizes.</p>

<p>Regular meetings will begin shortly after, with Main and Sunday meetings scheduled to begin on Tuesday 22nd October and Sunday 27th October respectively. The 2019/20 meetings schedule is under development, and will appear on our <a href="/meetings">Meetings</a> and <a href="/schedule">Schedule</a> pages once finalised.</p>
