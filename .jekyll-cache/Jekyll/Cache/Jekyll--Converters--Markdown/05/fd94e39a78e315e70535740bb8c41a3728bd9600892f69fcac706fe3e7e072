I"o<p>The CUSU Freshers’ Fair stall allocations are now up! We’ll be there on both days (Tuesday 8th and Wednesday 9th October) at MH6; row H, table 6 in the Marquee on Parker’s Piece. You’ll be able to see a couple of the finest committee members we have to hand, have a chat, join our mailing list and maybe even pick up a flyer. We hope to see you there!</p>
