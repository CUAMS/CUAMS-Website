I"X<p>As you are probably aware, <strong>we will be unable to meet for Easter term</strong> as the university will remain closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, this means that we will not be able to finish the shows that were scheduled for the Easter term in official CUAMS meetings.</p>

<p>All of the currently scheduled shows, with the exception of Spice &amp; Wolf, are available on Crunchyroll in the UK and we highly recommend watching them during the long period of social distancing/lockdown that lies ahead of us.</p>

<p>If you wish to discuss the shows or keep in touch with other members of the society in general during these times, feel free to join the <strong>official CUAMS discord server</strong> linked <a href="https://discord.gg/aA3Cpqw">here.</a></p>

<p>On behalf of the committee, we wish you all the best of health.</p>
