I"«<p>Hopefully everyone enjoyed our squash (and especially the amazing Summer Wars). Our main meetings are on Thursdays, with the first one at <strong>7pm on
Thursday, 21st October</strong>. Thursday meetings this term (and probably all through this year) will take place in the same place as the squash i.e.
<strong>the Chetwynd Room, Kingâ€™s College</strong>.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re following three series through this term - Working!!, Trapeze and Cross Game, and usually watching two episodes of each
per week, with breaks for drink and snack consumption. Some details are currently up on the <a href="/meetings/main">
Main Meetings</a> page, and synopses will be up there shortly (for now, you can follow the ANN links for brief synopses).</p>

<p>Members from last year, note that there is <strong>no Sunday meeting this week</strong>. Sunday meetings will start next week - full details will be in the e-mail
and on the next news post.</p>
