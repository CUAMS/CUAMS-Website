I"Î<p>Thanks to everyone who visited us at the Societiesâ€™ Fair, and welcome to the new academic year!</p>

<p>Our first meeting is the freshersâ€™ squash on <strong>Thursday, 16 October,</strong> from <strong>7 pm to 10 pm,</strong> in the <strong>Bowett Room, Queensâ€™ College.</strong> Come along (even if you werenâ€™t at the fair or arenâ€™t a student) to see some anime, get some snacks and drinks, sign up for membership and maybe even win a prize!</p>

<p>To get to the Bowett Room, follow the directions on <a href="/assets/images/posts/bowett-room.jpg">this map</a>. When you are inside the building circled on the map, go up the stairs on your right.</p>

<p>Most of our Thursday meetings this term will be in the same place. On Sundays, we will meet in Teaching Room 7 of Robinson College; see the <a href="/meetings/sunday">Sunday meeting page</a> for directions.</p>

<p>Old members, be careful! This year our main day of week is <strong>Thursday.</strong></p>
