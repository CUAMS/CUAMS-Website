I"½<p>The first meeting of the year is our freshersâ€™ squash <strong>next Tuesday, on 15 October, from 7 pm to 10 pm</strong>. Everyone is welcome, and weâ€™ll show two great anime films, Little Witch Academia and Paprika, as well as provide snacks and drinks. We will even have prizes up for grabs for those who sign up and pay their membership fees (Â£10/year or Â£4/term, which cover the snacks we have at every meeting!) during the night.</p>
