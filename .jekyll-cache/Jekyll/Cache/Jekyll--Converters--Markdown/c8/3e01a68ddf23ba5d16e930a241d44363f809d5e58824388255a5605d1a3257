I"Y<p>It is now Lent term, and CUAMS is starting a <strong>new repertoire of anime!</strong> This is the perfect opportunity to join us if you couldn’t come last term. Only two shows are continuing, both of which are very episodic, so you can dive right in even if you haven’t seen them before. Students and non-students alike are welcome!</p>
