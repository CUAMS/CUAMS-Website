I"ò<p>Once again, the meeting tomorrow, on <strong>Tuesday, 10 March,</strong> will be in the <strong>Auditorium Lounge, Robinson</strong> College. To get there, go through the <a href="http://map.cam.ac.uk/?inst=robin">main entrance</a> and straight across the courtyard, enter the door in front of you and immediately turn left. On the <a href="http://www.robinson.cam.ac.uk/about/college_plan.php">college plan</a> the Auditorium Lounge is marked 2, although the door is nearer to the digit 3.</p>
