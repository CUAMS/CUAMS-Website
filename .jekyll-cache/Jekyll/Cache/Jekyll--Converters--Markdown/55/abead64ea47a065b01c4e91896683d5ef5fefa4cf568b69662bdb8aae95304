<p>On <strong>Sunday, 18 May,</strong> we will be in the <strong>Music Practice Room,</strong> Robinson College. As you enter the college, turn right and walk along the Long Court as you would to reach the Umney Lounge, but instead of entering through the doors next to the stairs at the end of the Long Court, go up the stairs. Go right across the High Court and through the doors at the very end.</p>
