I"ã<p>I hope youâ€™re all settling back into university life, are excited to be
arriving back in Cambridge for another year soon or are preparing to come up to
Cambridge for the first time. With October around the corner, weâ€™re happy to
be able to give you more information about our freshersâ€™ events and the
schedule for Michaelmas term.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll be attending the Freshersâ€™ Fair on Tuesday 2nd and Wednesday 3rd October
between 10-4pm. Weâ€™ll be in the Kelsey Kerridge Sports Centre just over the
road from Parkerâ€™s Piece but there should be plenty of signs / people around to
point you in the direction on the day. Our stall number is KKE7 so whether
youâ€™re a new or regular member, come say hi. We also have some handy
<a href="/assets/images/posts/poster-2018.png">posters</a>
with our schedule for the year on them for you to take away.</p>

<p>We can also now announce that weâ€™ll be holding our Freshersâ€™ Squash on Saturday
13th October between 7-10pm in the
<a href="/assets/images/posts/bowett-room.jpg">Bowett Room in Queensâ€™ College</a> where
weâ€™ll be watching Voices of a Distant Star and When Marnie was There. The
squash is a great chance to meet other CUAMS members new and old and get a
taste of what CUAMS is like if itâ€™s your first time joining us. Thereâ€™ll also
be an anime themed raffle where you can win some anime DVDs and other goodies.</p>

<p>Finally, if you have not already seen, weâ€™ve updated our <a href="/schedule">schedule</a>
page to include the schedule for Michaelmas term which includes the location
and time of every meeting as well as the episodes that weâ€™re watching in each
meeting if you miss one and want to catch up. The full details can be found
over there but in general, most meetings (for both main and Sunday meetings)
will be in the Bowett Room in Queensâ€™ College although we have to move to some
other rooms in Queensâ€™ for some of the meetings. On Tuesday 23rd October, weâ€™ll
be in the Bowett Room and on Sunday 28th October and Tuesday 6th November,
weâ€™ll be in DD47. Weâ€™ll send out reminders closer to the time with more
information to make sure you donâ€™t get lost.</p>

<p>We hope to see lots of you at the Freshersâ€™ Fair and Squash and wish you all
luck in the coming year.</p>
