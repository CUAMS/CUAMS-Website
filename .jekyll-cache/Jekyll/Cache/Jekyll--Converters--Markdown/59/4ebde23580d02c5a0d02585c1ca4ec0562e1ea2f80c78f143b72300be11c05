I"P<p>A new academic year has started at Cambridge, and with it comes a new year of anime!</p>

<p>Freshers and old members alike, come see us at the <strong><a href="http://www.cusu.co.uk/get-involved/freshers-15">Freshers’ Fair</a></strong> in the <strong>marquee</strong> on <strong>Parker’s Piece (row 14, stall 4)</strong> on <strong>Tuesday and Wednesday!</strong></p>

<p>Our first meeting will be the traditional <strong>Freshers’ Squash</strong> on a not-so-traditional day, the <strong>Monday</strong> of <strong>12 October</strong>, in the <strong><a href="http://www.chambermusicians.org.uk/Bateman%20Auditorium.htm">Bateman Auditorium</a></strong> in Gonville and <strong>Caius</strong> College.</p>
