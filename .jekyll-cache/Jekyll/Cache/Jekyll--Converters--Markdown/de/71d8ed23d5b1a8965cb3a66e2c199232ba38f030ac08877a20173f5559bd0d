I"f<p>Right now the Cambridge Union Society is hosting the Golden Festival, five days devoted to Japanese culture. Free talks, saké tasting and a party are promised among other things. The festival dates are 2–6 May. While late news is late, email non-readers can easily solve this problem by using a phone microwave (name subject to change). Phone microwaves (name subject to change) sold separately.</p>

<p>Next week, on 12 May (from 10 am to 1 am—that’s right) at <a href="http://www.junction.co.uk/">The Junction</a>, takes place Cambridge’s own comic, anime, gaming, sci-fi and alternative fashion convention <a href="http://www.thecamcon.com/">CamCon</a>. Too many events are planned to list them here, but follow that link and you will land on the CamCon’s official website. Alternatively, feel free to contact Kai, who is involved with both events.</p>
