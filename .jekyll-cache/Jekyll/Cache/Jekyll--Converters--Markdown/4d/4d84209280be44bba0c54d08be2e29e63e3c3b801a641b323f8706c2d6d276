I"Ü<p>Firstly, we apologise for the disruption to last weekâ€™s Thursday meeting. We have checked with Kingâ€™s, and the very noisy group who was in Keynes Hall
last week will not be there again for the next couple of weeks, so meeetings will continue to be in the Chetwynd Room until further notice. If you
missed our move up to the Mumby Room, youâ€™ll probably want to get caught up as soon as possible. To do so, get in contact with a
committee member or come on to IRC.</p>
