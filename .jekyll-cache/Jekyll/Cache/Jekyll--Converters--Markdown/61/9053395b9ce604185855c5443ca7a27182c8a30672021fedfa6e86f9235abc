I"Ä<p>With exams looming upon us, CUAMS is switching to bonus meetings for the rest of the Easter term. We will be showing the same three new series on both Tuesdays and Sundays, but the series are carefully chosen so that each meeting is relatively independent of the others and can be easily missed.</p>

<p>If you havenâ€™t been following us from the start of last term, now is a great time to join. As a reminder, we have meetings on Tuesdays from 7 pm to 10 pm in the Auditorium Lounge and on Sundays from 4 pm to 7 pm in the Umney Lounge, all in Robinson College. For directions, see the <a href="/meetings/main">main</a>/<a href="/meetings/sunday">Sunday</a> meeting pages or the news entries below.</p>
