I"%<p>Welcome back everyone to the last term of this Cambridge year. CUAMS, unlike most other societies, is still going strong with the programme. Main meetings are back on Thursdays, but will  be taking place in the <em>Munby Room</em> (see the main meetings page for directions). Also please note that Sunday meetings are taking place from <em>3-6pm</em>, and not 4-7pm. Series from last term will be continuing in their respective meetings, until June where both Thursdays and Sundays will become bonus meetings (see schedule for more details).</p>
