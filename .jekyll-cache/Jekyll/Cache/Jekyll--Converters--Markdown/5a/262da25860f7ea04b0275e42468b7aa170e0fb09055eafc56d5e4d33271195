I"b<p>The Cambridge University Anglo-Japanese and Anime &amp; Manga Societies are proud to present Masa-kun!</p>

<p>Masa-kun comes from London to give his debut performance in Cambridge. In demand by Japanese organisations and anime conventions alike, he’ll entertain with a variety of Japanese songs, ranging from Hikaru Utada to Final Fantasy tunes. His philosophy is to entertain with his music, breaking away from the notion of the violin as a “classical” instrument. Masa-kun’s performances can be seen on his <a href="http://www.youtube.com/masamusic123">YouTube channel</a>. He will be accompanied by <a href="http://www.hibikishamisen.com/Home.html">Hibiki Ichikawa</a>, a professional shamisen player, who is also currently touring the UK.</p>

<p>AJS will be running a raffle during the intermission, with several bottles of umeshu up for grabs!</p>
