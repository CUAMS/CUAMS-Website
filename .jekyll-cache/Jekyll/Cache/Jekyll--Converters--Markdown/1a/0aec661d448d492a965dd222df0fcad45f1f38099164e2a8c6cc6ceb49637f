I"D<p>The CUSU Freshers’ Fair stall allocations are now up! We’ll be there on both days (Tuesday 8th and Wednesday 9th October) at MH6; row H, table 6 in the Marquee on Parker’s Piece. You’ll be able to see a couple of the finest committee members we have to hand, have a chat, join our mailing list and maybe even pick up a flyer. We hope to see you there!</p>

<p>The schedule will be announced ahead of this date; we’re currently waiting on licensing for a couple of shows in Lent, but we should be able to announce at least Michaelmas term by the end of the week!</p>

<p>If you want to get a feel for our activities before you arrive, feel free to check out rest of the website, and join our Discord server at <a href="https://discord.gg/aA3Cpqw">https://discord.gg/aA3Cpqw</a> to chat with existing members and others.</p>
