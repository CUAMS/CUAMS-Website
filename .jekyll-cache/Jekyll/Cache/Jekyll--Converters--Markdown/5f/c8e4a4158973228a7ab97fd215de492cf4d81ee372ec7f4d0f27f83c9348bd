I"<<p>It’s a new term, which means new shows. On Tuesdays, we will be showing <strong>Humanity has Declined!</strong>, <strong>Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu</strong>, and <strong>Spice and Wolf</strong>; on Sundays, we will be showing <strong>Kekkai Sensen</strong>, <strong>Plastic Memories</strong>, and (newly-announced) <strong>Hibike! Euphonium</strong>. We wanted to make sure a KyoAni show made it onto the schedule after last year’s events; apologies for the delays in licensing. As always, head to the <a href="/meetings">Meetings page</a> for more details.</p>
