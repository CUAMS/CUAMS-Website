I"á<p>We were unable to book Queensâ€™ this term. Nobody else stepped up to book a room in their college, and Robinsonâ€™s Auditorium Lounge has other events scheduled on some days, so we will be meeting in the <strong>Umney Lounge, Robinson College</strong> for all meetings, on <strong>both Tuesdays and Sundays</strong>.</p>

<p>There is one exception: no rooms were available on Sunday, 16 February. We have not yet found a substitute place for that meeting. If your college has an available room of suitable size (this being a Sunday, we will probably only have about a dozen people) that we can use, please get in touch with a committee member! For that matter, also get in touch if your college has a suitable room for Tuesdays.</p>
