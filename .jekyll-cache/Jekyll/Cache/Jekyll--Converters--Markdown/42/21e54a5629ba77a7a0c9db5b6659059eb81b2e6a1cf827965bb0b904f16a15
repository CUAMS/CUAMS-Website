<p>If there’s anyone who can’t make it to our Thursday meetings, or for whom three hours of CUAMS per week just isn’t enough, we also have
<a href="/meetings/sunday">Sunday meetings</a>, the first of which is tomorrow (that’s <strong>Sunday, 24th October</strong>),
running from <strong>4pm to 7pm</strong>.  They take place in Sidney Sussex college, R-Block Common Room, which for old members is the same place as last year. The route there is a bit complicated, so for new members, we’ll have people waiting <strong>just inside the main entrance to Sidney Sussex</strong> to take you to the room where our meetings are held. Our room for Sunday meetings is smaller than the room for Thursday meetings, so if you’re only planning on coming to one meeting per week and it is otherwise an arbitrary decision, we recommend Thursdays.</p>

<p>This term on Sundays, we’re following Baka To Test To Shoukanjuu, The Tatami Galaxy and Ookiku Furikabutte. Note that at the first meeting, however,
we’ll be showing the first episode of Denpa Teki no Kanojo instead of Ookiku Furikabutte - this is to resolve scheduling issues with differences in the
numbers of episodes of the series we’re watching. Ookiku Furikabutte will instead be starting at the following Sunday meeting.</p>
