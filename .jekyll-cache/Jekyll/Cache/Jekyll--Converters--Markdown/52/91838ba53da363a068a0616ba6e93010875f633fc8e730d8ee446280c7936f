I"¿<p>Hopefully everyone is enjoying the series that CUAMS has been showing, some of which will continue into next term. As we
near the end of the first term, there are a couple of changes to the norm worth noting. Firstly, this weekâ€™s main meeting is on
<strong>Friday, 26th November</strong> rather than the usual Thursday. Secondly, this weekâ€™s Sunday meeting is <strong>starting at 3pm</strong> rather than
the usual 4pm. Weâ€™ve also got some end-of-term bonus meetings coming up - more info on those nearer the time.</p>

<p>(As I imagine everyone noticed, the previous meeting was also on Friday, so this information should really have been up much sooner - sorry for
forgetting to update.)</p>
