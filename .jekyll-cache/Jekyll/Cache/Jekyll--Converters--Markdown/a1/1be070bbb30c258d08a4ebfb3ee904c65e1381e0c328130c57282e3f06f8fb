I"<p>In continuing caution regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, the committee has decided to carry out <strong>all CUAMS activities online for the duration of the Michaelmas term</strong>. This will happen primarily through the society <a href="https://discord.gg/aA3Cpqw">Discord</a>. The Tuesday main meetings will happen at the usual time, and will involve discussing the specified episodes of the anime, which you are asked to watch beforehand. Instead of a typical sunday meeting there are plans to instead have a manga book club, with more details to come closer to term.</p>

<p>At the main meetings we will be discussing the following shows: <strong>Given</strong>, <strong>Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!</strong> (Eizouken ni wa Te wo Dasu na!) and <strong>Land of the Lustrous</strong> (Houseki no Kuni). More details on the shows can be found on <a href="/meetings">the Meetings page.</a></p>

<p>There are also plans to hold a <strong>Virtual Fresher’s Squash</strong> on the <strong>13th of October</strong>, where we will watch <strong>Wolf Children</strong>. Dates and times will be available on <a href="/schedule">the Schedule page</a>, and again more information will arrive closer to term.</p>

<p>As of yet the plans for Lent and Easter are undecided, and will be dependant on the developing guidance from the government and the university in regards to gatherings and social distancing.</p>

<p>We hope you’re as excited as we are to watch these shows and talk about them together! Please fell free to hop onto <a href="https://discord.gg/aA3Cpqw">our Discord</a> and take a look at the #schedule_discussion channel to discuss the planned shows. <strong>Bonus:</strong> The <a href="/committee">the Committee page</a> page now has our discord usernames, why not stop by and say hi?</p>
