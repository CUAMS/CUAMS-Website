I"8<p>I hope you’ve all had a good break over the Christmas holidays but the new term
is right around the corner and so we can now announce our schedule for Lent
term. We’re watching all new shows so if you’re new to CUAMS or didn’t get to
come to meetings last term, this is the perfect time to start.</p>
