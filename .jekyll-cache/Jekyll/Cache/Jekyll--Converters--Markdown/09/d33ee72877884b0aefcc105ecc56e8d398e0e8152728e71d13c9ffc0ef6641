I"%<p><b>The following information describes the normal CUAMS activities, due to COVID-19 it is not correct for the near future.</b></p>

<p>CUAMS usually has two regular meetings per week during full term: a main
meeting on a weekday, and a second, smaller meeting on Sundays. We also hold
regular bonus meetings to fill any gaps. All meetings take place in a Cambridge
college, and we provide snacks and drinks to enhance the experience unless
otherwise specified.</p>

<p>Main meetings and Sunday meetings have different sets of shows, so there is no
obligation to attend both, but you’re welcome to do so if you want to maximise
your CUAMS anime intake.</p>

<p>Bonus meetings are mostly, if not entirely, independent from the other series
we’re watching, so feel free to come along to any that take your fancy.</p>

<p><b>Here is the current plan for Michaelmas 2020:</b></p>

<p>For Michaelmas this year, main meetings will be held on Tuesdays via <a href="https://discord.gg/aA3Cpqw">Discord</a>, from 7pm till 10pm. We will not be watching the shows during the meeting, instead the committee asks that you watch the specified episodes in advance and discuss them during the meeting. There will not be typical Sunday meetings but there are plans to run a manga book club instead, more information will be available closer to term.</p>

<p>For details on the times of bonus meetings, and more information for all specific meetings check out the <a href="/schedule">schedule</a> page. A
summary of the shows that we will be watching this year can be found below:</p>
