I"<p>Hopefully everyone is enjoying the series that CUAMS has been showing, some of which will continue into next term. As we
near the end of the first term, there are a couple of changes to the norm worth noting. Firstly, this week’s main meeting is on
<strong>Friday, 26th November</strong> rather than the usual Thursday. Secondly, this week’s Sunday meeting is <strong>starting at 3pm</strong> rather than
the usual 4pm. We’ve also got some end-of-term bonus meetings coming up - more info on those nearer the time.</p>
