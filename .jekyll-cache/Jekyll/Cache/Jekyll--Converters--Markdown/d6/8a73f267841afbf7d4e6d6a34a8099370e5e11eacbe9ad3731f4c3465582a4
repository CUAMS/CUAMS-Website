I"ù<p>CUAMS is the Cambridge University Anime and Manga Society. It was founded over
a decade ago as CUCAS (Cambridge University Comics and Animation Society) with
the intention of promoting comics and animation in general throughout
Cambridge. Our focus has since shifted to specifically Japanese anime and
manga, though our membership still consumes a wide variety of media.</p>

<p>We show anime twice a week: a main meeting on a weekday, and a second, smaller
meeting on Sundays. Both meetings last about 3 hours, including breaks for
drinks and snacks, and we tend to show episodes from three different series at
each meeting â€” you can check the <a href="/schedule">schedule page</a> to see what weâ€™re
currently showing and how far through we are.</p>

<p>There are also occasional trips out to restaurants, the cinema, and the annual
Garden Party. We aim to at least mention everything through either e-mail or
the website, but more informal events often end up being organised through
<a href="https://discord.gg/aA3Cpqw">Discord</a>. If you have any questions or just want to
keep in touch, feel free to join.</p>

<p>The society is open to all and not just limited to students and staff of the
university so if youâ€™re in the area, feel free to come say hi.</p>
