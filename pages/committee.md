The committee are the brave volunteers responsible for the organisation (or
lack thereof) of CUAMS. Elections for the committee are held each year towards
the end of the Lent term, so if youâ€™re interested in running for a position,
then is the time to make your intentions known.

The committee as a whole can be contacted by e-mailing
<mailto:{{ site.email }}>, or you can feel free to approach / harrass them at
any meetings you see them at. They promise not to bite...
