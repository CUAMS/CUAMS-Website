We hold two regular meetings per week most weeks during full term, taking a break in Easter
term to allow people to focus on their exams. All meetings are held in a Cambridge college
somewhere (usually Queens) with snacks and drinks to enhance the experience. For details
on locations, timings and which episodes will be watched when, check out the schedule page.

The shows shown at main meetings and Sunday meetings will be different so there is no
obligation to attend both meetings in each week in order to keep up with what is going on.
However, you are also welcome to attend both meetings if you want to maximise your CUAMS
anime intake.

In addition to the main meetings we may have extra bonus meetings. Typically these will be
at the start or end of term or used to fill any gaps in the schedule. Most, if not, all of
these meetings will be independent from the other series being watched at CUAMS so they are
a good opportunity to come to a meeting if you don't want to commit to watching a whole
series during term time.
