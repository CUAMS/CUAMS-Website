CUAMS is the Cambridge University Anime and Manga Society. It was founded over
a decade ago as CUCAS (Cambridge University Comics and Animation Society) with
the intention of promoting comics and animation in general throughout
Cambridge. Our focus has since shifted to specifically Japanese anime and
manga, though our membership still consumes a wide variety of media.

The society has typically focused on providing weekly showings of anime twice a
week, however, this year we are trialling aiming a more social set of events that
allow us to provide a greater variety of experiences to the members of the 
society while remaining true to our roots.

The events that we will aim to host this year include karaoke, pub meets,
anime and movie screenings, convention meets, cinema meets, art events, members' 
formals, and the annual Garden Party. We aim to at least mention everything through either e-mail or
the website, but more informal events often end up being organised through
[Discord]({{site.discord_link}}). If you have any questions or just want to
keep in touch, feel free to join.

The society is open to all and not just limited to students and staff of the
university so if you're in the area, feel free to come say hi.
