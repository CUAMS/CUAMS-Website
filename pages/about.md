CUAMS is the Cambridge University Anime and Manga Society. It was founded over a decade ago
as CUCAS (Cambridge University Comics and Animation Society) with the intention of
promoting comics and animation in general throughout Cambridge. Nowadays we tend to
focus on mainly Japanese animation.

We show anime twice a week: a main meeting on a weekday, and a second, smaller meeting on
Sundays. Both meetings last about 3 hours, including breaks for drinks and snacks, and we
tend to show episodes from three different series at each meeting — you can look at the
pages for each meeting to see what we’re currently showing and how far through we are.

There are also occasional trips out to restaurants, the cinema, and the annual Garden
Party1. Although we aim to at least mention everything through either e-mail or the
schedule, most of the more informal events end up being organised through
[Discord]({{site.discord_link}}), which is recommended to anyone who wants to fully
take part in the fun and games.

Membership costs £4 per term or £10 per year, which funds the weekly showings including
the food and drink at the meetings. Membership is open to anyone, not just University
students.
