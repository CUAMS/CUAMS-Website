Under current plans for Michaelmas 2022, CUAMS will not be hosting weekly 
anime screenings as done in past years, however we will still aim to show
various anime and movie screenings throughout the year.

All meetings take place in a Cambridge
college, and we provide snacks and drinks to enhance the experience unless
otherwise specified.

For details on the times of planned anime and movies screenings this year, check out the [schedule](/schedule) page. A
summary of the shows that we have/will be watching this year can be found below:
