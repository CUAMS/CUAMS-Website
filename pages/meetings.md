We hold two regular meetings per week most weeks during full term, taking a
break in Easter term to allow people to focus on their exams. All meetings
are held in a Cambridge college somewhere (usually Queens') with snacks and
drinks to enhance the experience.

The shows shown at main meetings and Sunday meetings will be different so
there is no obligation to attend both meetings in each week in order to keep
up with what is going on. However, you are also welcome to attend both meetings
if you want to maximise your CUAMS anime intake.

In addition to the main meetings we may have extra bonus meetings. Typically
these will be at the start or end of term or used to fill any gaps in the
schedule. Most, if not, all of these meetings will be independent from the
other series being watched at CUAMS so they are a good opportunity to come to a
meeting if you don't want to commit to watching a whole series during term
time.

This year, main meetings will be held on Tuesdays between 7-10pm and Sunday
meetings (as the name suggests) will be held on Sundays between 2.30-5.30pm.
For details on the times of bonus meetings as well as the locations and more
information for all meetings, check out the [schedule](/schedule) page. A
summary of the shows that we will be watching this year can be found below:
