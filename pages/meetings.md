<b>The following information describes the normal CUAMS activities, due to COVID-19 it is not correct for the near future.</b>

CUAMS usually has two regular meetings per week during full term: a main
meeting on a weekday, and a second, smaller meeting on Sundays. We also hold
regular bonus meetings to fill any gaps. All meetings take place in a Cambridge
college, and we provide snacks and drinks to enhance the experience unless
otherwise specified.

Main meetings and Sunday meetings have different sets of shows, so there is no
obligation to attend both, but you're welcome to do so if you want to maximise
your CUAMS anime intake.

Bonus meetings are mostly, if not entirely, independent from the other series
we're watching, so feel free to come along to any that take your fancy.

<b>Here is the current plan for Lent 2021:</b>

For Lent this year, meetings will be held on Fridays via [Discord]({{ site.discord_link }}), starting officialy at 7pm, though often beginning proper at around 8pm. These meetings are simple game nights, we are not watching shows this term. Current popular choices include Sketchful.io, Anime Music Quiz and various online board games - but people are encouraged to suggest any games at the meeting that people might enjoy. We may or may not also discuss anime and related topics at these.

For details on the times of bonus meetings, and more information for all specific meetings check out the [schedule](/schedule) page. A
summary of the shows that we have/will be watching this year can be found below:
