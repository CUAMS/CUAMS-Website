CUAMS usually has two regular meetings per week during full term: a main
meeting on a weekday, and a second, smaller meeting on Sundays. We also hold
regular bonus meetings to fill any gaps. All meetings take place in a Cambridge
college, and we provide snacks and drinks to enhance the experience unless
otherwise specified.

Main meetings and Sunday meetings have different sets of shows, so there is no
obligation to attend both, but you're welcome to do so if you want to maximise
your CUAMS anime intake.

Bonus meetings are mostly, if not entirely, independent from the other series
we're watching, so feel free to come along to any that take your fancy.

This year, main meetings will be held on Tuesdays between 7-10pm and Sunday
meetings (as the name suggests) will be held on Sundays between 2.30-5.30pm.
For details on the times of bonus meetings as well as the locations and more
information for all meetings, check out the [schedule](/schedule) page. A
summary of the shows that we will be watching this year can be found below:
