<b>The following information describes the normal CUAMS activities, but due to COVID-19 it is not all correct at the moment.</b>

CUAMS usually has two regular meetings per week during full term: a main
meeting on a weekday, and a second, smaller meeting on Sundays. We also hold
regular bonus meetings to fill any gaps. All meetings take place in a Cambridge
college, and we provide snacks and drinks to enhance the experience unless
otherwise specified.

Main meetings and Sunday meetings have different sets of shows, so there is no
obligation to attend both, but you're welcome to do so if you want to maximise
your CUAMS anime intake.

Bonus meetings are mostly, if not entirely, independent from the other series
we're watching, so feel free to come along to any that take your fancy.

<b>Here is the current plan for the Academic Year 2021-2022:</b>

Due to the Covid-19 situation improving we are able to once again have in-person meetings! We will be aiming to have a main meeting at 7pm every Tuesday, but it usually takes a while to confirm bookings and arrangements, so you can still expect regular online game nights. For information on events, times and locations check the most recent emails or ask on the [Discord server]({{ site.discord_link }}).

For details on the times of bonus meetings, and more information for all specific meetings check out the [schedule](/schedule) page. A
summary of the shows that we have/will be watching this year can be found below:
